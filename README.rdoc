Spike for using Rails and KO.js for a complex form. The goal is to do things the Rails Way, relying on KO and a small client-side model to simplify client logic. The POST is still handled by HTML inputs named after the Rails convention, and the authoritative model is kept in the DOM. The client-side models attributes are automatically generated using the KO mapping plugin.
